### Consumer Step 1 (Creating the first contract)

Although all the tests are passing, there is a bug introduced on purpose in `spec/payment_service_client_spec.rb`. Can you spot it?

The PaymentService API returns a response that contains a payment method `status`, but the test has incorrectly assumed that the response contains a `state` field.

The unit test that lives in `spec/payment_service_client_spec.rb` is pretty much useless.

If there is a change in the provider API, the test will continue to pass, but the communication between the consumer and the provider will be broken.

At this stage we have 3 alternatives to workaround this issue:

  1. Create an End to End test that involves the consumer and the provider (PaymentService)
  2. Create an Integration test for the API that PaymentService is exposing
  3. Implement a Contract test

Creating and E2E test is expensive since in a CD environment you will need to have instances of both microservices running in order to execute the test.

Creating an Integration test for the API that PaymentService is exposing is a good alternative but it has some drawbacks.

  - If the test is written in the provider side, if the API changes it is going to be difficult to make the consumer aware of the change
  - If the test is written on the consumer side, you will need an instance of the provider (PaymentService) running in order to be able to execute the test

We will explore Option 3, and we will implement a Contract test using [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/)
___

Create this file `spec/pact_helper.rb` with the following content

```ruby
require 'pact/consumer/rspec'

Pact.service_consumer "PaymentServiceClient" do
  has_pact_with "PaymentService" do
    mock_service :payment_service do
      host "localhost"
      port 4567
    end
  end
end
```

With this `pact_helper` file, we are configuring Pact in the consumer.

When a Pact test is run, Pact will intercept the HTTP requests happening against `localhost:4567` (based on this configuration) and it will return the predefined responses specified in the test. The value `localhost:4567` is used here because that is the value that we use as a default if the `PAYMENT_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` environment variable is not set. You can take a look at `PaymentServiceClient` class in `lib/payment_service_client.rb` file to see how this is done.

Pact will create a contract based on the expectations declared in the tests and the contract will be used in the provider side for its verification.

Replace `spec/payment_service_client_spec.rb` with the following content in order to convert the previous unit test to a Pact contract test.

```ruby
require "pact_helper"
require "payment_service_client"

RSpec.describe PaymentServiceClient, pact: true do
  let(:payment_method) { "1234123412341234" }
  let(:response_body) do { state: :valid } end

  before do
    payment_service
      .upon_receiving("a request for validating a payment method")
      .with(method: :get, path: "/validate-payment-method/#{payment_method}")
      .will_respond_with(
        status: 200,
        headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"},
        body: response_body
      )
  end

  it "calls payment service to validate payment method" do
    expect(subject.validate(payment_method)).to eql({ "state" => "valid" })
  end
end
```

Notice how we added the `pact: true` parameters in the describe block to allow Pact to identify this test as a Pact test.

Run the tests with `rspec`. At this stage a new contract should be generated in the `spec/pacts` directory.
Take a look at the content of the file in JSON format that contains the contract definition.

Navigate to the directory in where you checked out `pact-workshop-provider`, run `git checkout provider-step1` and follow the instructions in the **Provider's** readme file
